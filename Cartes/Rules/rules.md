## Game summary

You choose the duration of the game. It consists of a succession of rounds of about 7 minutes, during which players can earn points or draw cards. 

Players will take turns trying to get a majority of other players to guess a spurious argument card during an improvisational skit based on a randomly drawn scenario.

At the end of the time limit, the round is over and the player with the most points wins the game.

## Installation

Depending on the number of players and the desired level of difficulty, the deck of fallacy cards is built up by adding the levels shown at the bottom right of the cards in ascending order. A minimum of 8 cards per player is required. 

Fallacy cards are shuffled, as well as scenario cards. Two piles of scenario cards are made up and placed in the middle of the table. Each player is dealt 5 fallacy cards which they keep for themselves. The rest of the cards make up the draw pile. 

The first drawer is drawn at random. Each player has a small unique object (coin, bean...) for voting.

## Course of a round

### 1.       The drawer

The drawer draws a scenario map from the two available picks and reads it aloud, except for the last sentence in italics at the bottom of the map.

### 2.       The smooth talker

The Smooth talker will be in charge of leading the argumentation of the scenario, to illustrate one of his fallacious argument cards. His objective will be to make a majority of other players guess this card, without everyone discovering it.

The role of the Smooth talker is assigned to the first player who lays, face down, the fallacy card he intends to play. Otherwise, the player to the left of the drawer is designated as the Smooth talker and places his card.

### 3.       The skit

The drawer starts the debate as he wishes. He can use the suggestion in italics at the bottom of the scenario map. The smooth talker and the drawer then have a maximum of one minute to improvise a discussion during which the smooth talker will try to use the type of argument indicated by the card he has chosen.

 The smooth talker presents his arguments and the drawer gives him the reply. The smooth talker can choose to shorten the skit at any time.

### 4.       The jury

All players except the smooth talker, but including the drawer, make up the jury. At the end of the skit, each member of the jury chooses among his own cards the one that comes closest to the argument heard and puts it face down with the one of the smooth talker. The latter picks up the cards, shuffles them and reveals them in the middle of the table.

The members of the jury take note of the revealed cards, one of them can read them out loud. When the jury is ready, without consultation, each of its members simultaneously designates the card that he thinks has been played by the smooth talker by placing his unique small object on it.

### 5.       The points count

If the smooth talker's card is designated by the whole jury, each draw a card except the smooth talker. His left neighbor becomes the next drawer.

Otherwise, the winner of the round is the one whose card has got the most votes, either as a smooth talker or as a member of the jury. He then keeps his card which is worth 1 deck and puts it face up in front of him. He does not draw a new card. In the event of a tie, the players who found the player's card are declared winners, and if there is no tie, the player who found the player's card wins.

With the exception of the winner, the members of the jury who have obtained votes or who have found the card of the smooth talker draw 2 cards. The other players, including the player who did not win the round, draw 1 card. Played cards are returned to the deck.

The winner's left-hand neighbour becomes the drawer for the next round.

## Variants :

*	Several fallacy cards can be played in a single round.
*	The drawer has the right to directly designate the smooth talker for the round.	
*	The winner of the game has to play the smooth talker for a final scenario where he has to play all the cards he won during the game.
