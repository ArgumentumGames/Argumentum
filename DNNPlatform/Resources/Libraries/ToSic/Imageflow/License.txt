Everything in 2sxc is <em>free open source</em> :)

2sxc itself is released under the MIT license. It also uses many other open source components with different open-source licenses, from AGPL to X11. 

If you want to know more, read our <a href="http://2sxc.org/License" target="_blank">license page</a>. It also contains instructions how to switch from the really cool, copyleft AGPL image resizer to the simpler one with an Apache license.
