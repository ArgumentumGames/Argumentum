### Chronofresh
Chronofesh is used for shipping when ANY product in the cart has a property of Chronofresh.  (ref: chronofresh)

If a product does have a "chronofresh" property, ALL products will be sent by Chronofresh and the cost of shipping will be calculated for Chronofresh only.

Therefore a property with a reference of "chronofresh" must be setup in the system and attached to products, if chronofresh is to be used.

### International
If international postage is required, then the best price for international shipping will be selected as the shipping price.

### Standard Chronopost

If no products have the "chronofresh" property, then the best price for standard Chronopost will be selected as the shipping price.  

### Shipping Not Available

If shipping is not available, then an error message will be displayed to the client on the cart summary page and the "Payment" button will be hidden.
