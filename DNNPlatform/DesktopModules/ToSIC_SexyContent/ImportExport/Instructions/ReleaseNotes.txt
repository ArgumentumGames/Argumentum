This is a 2sxc-App, something much cooler than a standard DNN-module. And it's easy to add and remove again, and you can install it per portal. So...

If you got this far, you should <a href="http://2sxc.org/en/help?tag=install-app" target="_blank">read the help on installing Apps</a>.



Do NOT continue, this cannot be installed


























I'm serious - don't try to install this, it won't work


























Really, it won't.

























Just let it be ok?































Close this dialog now, install using 2sxc.
