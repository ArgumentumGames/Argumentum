This means, if you create anything using the additonal plugins, you must also publish your work as open-source, or purchase a license.

Our (2sics) work creating this DNN bundle is licensed under MIT. But that's just the DNN-Packager. <br>
Basically if you're using the Resizer in a fully open source setup and publish your work (AGPL-Style) you can also use the pro-edition for free, otherwise you must get a licenses from Imazen.
