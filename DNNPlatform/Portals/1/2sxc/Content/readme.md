## Purpose

Each DNN portal using [2sxc][2sxc] has a section called **Content** which contains the main content-types and main templates. This could be initialized manually, but in most cases it's more efficient to install a set of best-practice content-types and templates. To ensure this stuff looks good, these content-types and templates should be optimized to the CSS-framework in use.

## Quick-Start

1. Almost everything you want to know is in the [wiki](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-content-app/wiki)
1. **Installation**: Whenever you install 2sxc on a DNN portal, or when you create a new portal on a [DNN with 2sxc installed](http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Install-2sxc), 2sxc will automatically ask you to install this. If you need to know more, read about [installations in the wiki](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-content-app/wiki/Installation-Instructions).

## Customize the App

1. **Skin/Theme Optimizations**: We have some recommendations, if you care about this, read about the [optimizations in the wiki](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-content-app/wiki/Theme-Optimizations)
1. **Customize to your colors and CSS**: check out the [instructions in the wiki](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-content-app/wiki/Customizing%20CSS%20or%20SASS)
