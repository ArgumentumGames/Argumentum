// ** Information in case you're new to this**
// This is an SCSS file. 
// It generates the css file using Bootstrap4 standards.
// To regenerate the SCSS using your variables (custom colors, etc.)
// you can update the reference to your _variables.scss of your skin
// please read the readme.md in this folder.

// Include needed variables from Bootstrap 3
// You must adapt the path to match your Bootstrap 3 skin
// @import "../../../_default/skins/2sxcBootstrap-B3/src/_variables.scss";

// Map all relevant variables to bs4 convention 
// so we can use bs4 standard variable names in the other SCSS files
@import "bs4-polyfills/_map-bs3-vars-to-bs4.scss";

// Include mixins which are defined in Boostrap 4 but not in Bootstrap 3
// this is important because the other SCSS use bootstrap 4 conventions
// and they wouldn't work otherwise
@import "bs4-polyfills/_breakpoints.scss";

@import "_variables.scss"; 

@import "_styles.scss"; // General CSS stuff for everything
