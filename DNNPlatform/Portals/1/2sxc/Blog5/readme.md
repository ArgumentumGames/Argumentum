## Customize the App

If you want to use the "Home top posts" template, you need to ["Configure Main-List and Details Page"](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/c42g7EjU) in the app settings.
There are also a lot of app resources you can adjust to your needs.

If you want to customize the CSS, you will usually follow the ["Create Custom Styles in a Standard 2sxc App" checklist](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/gg_aB9FD)

* Updated to 2sxc 12.03 features like using global settings, images etc.
