# WebApi in the root /api folder

These files are included for the most basic examples of using WebApi. 

As we recommend to use [polymorph APIs](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/wiki/concept-polymorph) which allow you to have a live API (for your users) and other copies for development and testing, the remaining examples are located in `live/api`.
