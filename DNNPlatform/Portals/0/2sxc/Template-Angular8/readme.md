# App Template for Angular 8 Best Practices with DNN and 2sxc

## What is this?

If you wish to develop Angular within DNN, the initial setup can be challenging. This template App solves a bunch of problems for you, like:

1. develop on your local system with hot-reloading as you work
1. use DNN and 2sxc WebAPIs out-of-the box with all the right headers
1. multiple code editions, so you can test staging code on the production server, without interrupting users who see the live edition

## How to Install

The app can be installed from 2sxc (inside DNN). Follow [these instructions](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/oCmPBI3p).
