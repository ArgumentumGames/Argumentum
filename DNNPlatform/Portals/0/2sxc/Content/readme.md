You can read more about the included content-types and templates in this [blog-post](http://2sxc.org/en/blog/post/27-responsive-bootstrap3-structured-content-design-templates-for-dnn-and-2sxc)

## Purpose

Each DNN portal using [2sxc][2sxc] has a section called **Content** which contains the main content-types and main templates. This could be initialized manually, but in most cases it's more efficient to install a set of best-practice content-types and templates. To ensure this stuff looks good, these content-types and templates should be optimized to the CSS-framework in use.

This package **Content-Bootstrap3** is the default configuration package which 2sxc offers for Bootstrap installations.
