## Creating Awesome Designed Content (move to docs)

You now have created the layout within minutes or hours, but you're still missing the perfectly designed inner pieces, like tile-lists, content-accordeons, galleries, sliders, blogs and more. Fortunately these are both super-easy to add and use the same mechanisms for design. They can even re-use the variables of your skin, to automatically match look and feel :)

To get the awesome designed content, install [2sxc](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/releases) and the default Bootstrap 5 content-templates.
