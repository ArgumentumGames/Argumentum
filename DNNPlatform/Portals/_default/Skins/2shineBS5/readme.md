# DNN Skin/Theme Bootstrap5 Instant! for DNN 7, 8, 9 (works best with 9.6+)

_Note: two links in the footer go to pages in dnn 9.6, which uses a 9.6 api. if you remove them, it also works in v7/8_

A clean, prepared bootstrap5 skin for DNN (DotNetNuke), ready to make awesomeness - ideally combined with bootstrap content-templates.

1. This theme needs the [2Shine BS5 Container](https://github.com/2sic/dnn-container-2shine-bs5) to work, but this gets installed automatically for you when you install the theme with the installer.

## Creating Awesome Designed Content (move to docs)

You now have created the layout within minutes or hours, but you're still missing the perfectly designed inner pieces, like tile-lists, content-accordeons, galleries, sliders, blogs and more. Fortunately these are both super-easy to add and use the same mechanisms for design. They can even re-use the variables of your skin, to automatically match look and feel :)

To get the awesome designed content, install [2sxc](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/releases) and the default Bootstrap 5 content-templates.
