<h1 id="argumentum">Argumentum</h1>
<p>Argumentum is a card-game about Argumentation. The Argumentum project involved creating tools to generate and distribute the end-material, but also to ease updating the content that it is made of.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to play</h2>
<p>The game is played with two decks of cards. Most rules involve rounds where a small card is drawn and playes will compete to play and catch fallacy large cards from their hands or common pot.</p>
<p>More information (currently in French) is available on the project&#39;s website <a href="https://www.argumentum.games">https://www.argumentum.games</a></p>
<h2 id="content-of-the-repository">Content of the repository</h2>
<p>The repository contains the following folders:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 tools in <a href="/Argumentum/Generation">Cartes/Generation</a> make up for most of the generation workflow:<ul>
            <li>
                <a href="/Argumentum/Generation/CardPen/index.html">CardPen</a> is a customized version of <a href="https://github.com/mcdemarco/">M.C DeMarco</a>&#39;s cardpen from before it got a new home in Github. Merging improvements would be mutually benificial at some point.
                Cardpen can generate a set of templated cards by injecting csv data into a mustache + css html template system.
                You need 2 cardpen json files (1 for face, 1 for back) to specify a physical playing card.
            </li>
            <li><a href="/Argumentum/Generation/Converters">Converters</a> holds a multi-purpose packaging and pipeline processing command line utility that reads a large XML configuration file to specify how to process and assemble Cardpen scenarii to build the send-to-print document. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/Argumentum/Cartes">Cartes</a>: Then generally gathers cardpen configurations to build the decks that make Argumentum, with folders for each type, together with assets and archives.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/Argumentum/DNNPlatform">DNNPlatform</a>: contains the web application that is used for the www.argumentum.games website, and that is a DNN ASP.Net application with the use of 2 community extensions, 2Sxc, which holds most content, and Open-store, which holds the selling point.  </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-generate-the-cards-and-the-images">How to generate the cards and the images</h2>
<p>
    Build and Run Converters once to generate a default configuration if needed.
    Host the cardpen instance locally.
    Update the converters config to point to your local hosted website.
    Run Converters to generate the cards and the images.
</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-the-website">How to build the website</h2>
<p>The website is currently commited without the data and decryptionkey, implying a fresh install of DNN should preexist before attempting a merge, which is a significant inconvenience. Further effort should help anonymizing a snapshot of the DNN DB, whith all pages configured.</p>
