Given a text in natural language, the selected type of formal logic used for analysis, the corresponding translation into a belief set, a list of queries to be tested, and the result of the queries processed by the Tweety logic library, interpret the result, by explaining the accepted or rejected responses based on the belief set. Analyze the logical implications of the responses and connect them to the arguments or premises from the text to reinforce the conclusions.
Remember to explicitly map each proposition in the belief set and each query to its meaning in the text, and to clarify that a rejected query doesn't directly invalidate any specific claim in the text, but simply represents a combination of conditions that isn't supported by the belief set.

[Input]
===TEXT TO ANALYSE
Si Alice, Bob ou Charlie sont présents, alors la réunion peut avoir lieu. Si Alice n'est pas là, alors Bob doit être là. Si Bob n'est pas là, alors Charlie doit être là. Enfin, si Charlie n'est pas là, alors Alice, Bob, Charlie et Daniel ne doivent pas être là.

===END QUERY TO TEST
===TWEETY RESULT
The query !a && !b is accepted by the belief set.
The query !c && !d is accepted by the belief set.
===END TWEETY RESULT
+++++
The result indicates that the queries "!a && !b" and "!c && !d" are both accepted by the belief set. This implies, according to the logic provided in the belief set, that the meeting can indeed occur even if both Alice and Bob are not present or even if both Charlie and Daniel are not present.

In the first case, the meeting can occur due to the condition that if both Alice and Bob are not there, Charlie could still enable the meeting to occur, based on the logic provided in the text. In the second case, the meeting can still happen even if both Charlie and Daniel are not there, which is based on the text that if Charlie is not present, then Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Daniel should not be there. Since the query "!c && !d" was accepted by the belief set, it implies that either Alice or Bob could be present to enable the meeting.
