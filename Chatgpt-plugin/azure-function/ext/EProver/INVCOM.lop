# Only unit clauses in infix-equational notation.

# There exists a right-neutral element (0).
f(X,0)=X.

# For each X, there is a right inverse element i(X).
f(X,i(X))=0.

# f is associative.
f(f(X,Y),Z)=f(X,f(Y,Z)).

# Skolemized and inverted hypothesis: Multiplication with inverse
# element is commutative.  
f(a,i(a)) != f(i(a),a).
