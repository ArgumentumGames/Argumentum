<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Version: 3.7<br>
<br>
       - All source files moved to FreeBSD licence.<br>
       <br>
       - Proof search is no longer entered if time limit or loops are 0.<br>
      <br>
       - If the Sorts flag is set, Flotter prints clauses with set sort
constraints.<br>
      <br>
       - Default for Sorts is now correctly set to 1, reflecting
documentation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 3.5<br>
<br>
       - Moved distribution to the FreeBSD licence.<br>
       <br>
       - Joined the flags -PCRW und -PREW into the latter, renamed -QuantExch
into -CNFQuantExch.<br>
<br>
       - For Linux binaries SPASS now always respects a given time limit.<br>
<br>
<br>
       - Moved to a fair and eager splitting heuristic. The new flag
-SplitMinInst, sets the minimal<br>
         average number of instances of all split atoms of a split in order to
perfrom the split and is<br>
         increased after each subsequent split and reset after performance of a
different inference.<br>
         Propositional non-Horn clauses are always split.<br>
         Removed the flag -SplitHeuristic.<br>
<br>
       - Reimplemented the conjunctive normal form algorithm of FLOTTER.<br>
<br>
       - Added printing of the number of performed splits to the output.<br>
<br>
       - Added improved split backtracking where also the split information of
a left branch refutation<br>
         is stored and then compared to the split information of the
corresponding right branch, potentially<br>
         leading to a more aggressive branch condensing. See the papers on
Splitting by Fietzke and Weidenbach.<br>
<br>
       - Added subterm contextual rewriting with fault caching. See the man
page and the corresponding<br>
         papers by Weidenbach &amp; Wischnewski.<br>
<br>
       - Added support for XOR, NAND, NOR and special symbol for NOT EQUAL to
DFG syntax.<br>
<br>
       - Added new translator tptp2dfg from TPTP syntax to DFG syntax. See the
man page.<br>
<br>
       - Added include directives to the SPASS DFG input syntax. For more
information see the syntax description.<br>
<br>
       - Removed a bunch of compile time constants hindering handling of large
files.<br>
<br>
       - Added native TPTP syntax support, controlled by the -TPTP flag.<br>
<br>
       - Moved from a sort theory module considering residues to a purely
declaration based sort theory.<br>
<br>
       - New self written command line parser.<br>
<br>
       - Added the flags -CNFSub, -CNFCon, -CNFRedTimeLimit to FLOTTER that
control<br>
         the use of subsumption, condensing and the overall time for reduction
during<br>
         cnf transformation. See the man pages for further details.<br>
<br>
       - Added rewriting with unoriented equations to forward and<br>
         backward rewriting. Until Version 3.0 only for unit equations <br>
         both directions were implemented.<br>
<br>
       - Fixed all known bugs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 3.0<br>
<br>
      -  Build the extended modal logic translation technology coming
from<br>
         MSPASS into SPASS. This also results in a number of new flags.
The<br>
         modal formulae are handled by translation to FOL, build into
FLOTTER.<br>
         See the handbook and man page.<br>
      <br>
      -  Added two more formula renaming strategies for complex as<br>
         well as quantified formulae.<br>
      <br>
      -  Added additional selection strategies via the Select flag and<br>
         the input file option &quot;set_Selection&quot;. See the man
page.<br>
<br>
      -  Added extended SPASS model format for saturated clause sets. The new
clause<br>
         format is close to the format at run time and enables marking of
selected<br>
         literals.<br>
<br>
      -  Implemented the  new settings command set_ClauseFormulaRelation
that<br>
         allows to give the clause formula relation in the input file.<br>
         If FLOTTER is called or the flag DOCPROOF for SPASS is set,<br>
         this relation is computed.<br>
<br>
      -  In full reduction mode, the reduction potential of unit clauses for
splitting<br>
         is now considered with respect to the usable and worked-off clauses.
In lazy<br>
         reduction mode, only worked off clauses are considered, as it was
before for<br>
         both modes. This has an effect on the selection of clauses for
splitting.<br>
<br>
      -  During clause generation at parse time, the literal true, not(false)
is no<br>
         longer deleted (the clause was not generated before) but handled<br>
         later on during input reduction.<br>
         This prevents strange error messages like &quot;No Clauses found&quot;
<br>
         in case the clause set contains a single clause &quot; -&gt;
true&quot;.<br>
<br>
      -  Added the alarm module (alarm.[ch]) that stops SPASS after<br>
         reaching the set time limit via a signal mechanism in order<br>
         to prevent the mainloop time polling for taking too long to
stop.<br>
         The alarm is set wirh respect to the value of the TimeLimit
flag.<br>
<br>
      -  Changed the static constant in the subsumption module that determined
the max.<br>
         length of a clause to a flexible run time parameter. Prevents some
ugly crashes.<br>
         Now the clause literal marking vectors are dynamically allocated and
adjusted.<br>
         We will apply this transformation to all static constants in the next
releases.<br>
<br>
      -  Changed error reporting in dfgparser.y to verbose.<br>
         <br>
<br>
      -  Fixed the following bugs:<br>
            the flag flag_CNFFEQREDUCTIONS was forgotten to transfer to
FLOTTER<br>
            if DocProof is set now the clause axiom relation is still printed<br>
            supressed printing of predefined symbols in case of model
output<br>
            fixed missing label enumeration of sort declarations<br>
            fixed compiler warnings of gcc 3.3 and gcc 4.1.<br>
            fixed the symbol order to the input order when FLOTTER prints the
CNF<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 2.2<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in the sort module where an inference was missing.<br>
<br>
      - Some small changes to extend output in CHECK mode.<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in fol_ReplaceVariable where an &quot;else&quot; branch was
missing.<br>
<br>
      - Added another splitting heuristic where input conjecture ground clauses
are always split.<br>
        The splitting heuristics can be controlled by the new flag
&quot;SplitHeuristic&quot;.<br>
<br>
      - Extended the documentation of DOCSPLIT, if set to 2, it now also prints
the backtracked clauses.<br>
<br>
      - Changed makefile option names (now prefixed SPASS).<br>
<br>
      - The timing module is now based on gettimeofday to be compatible with
the MAC infrastructure.<br>
<br>
      - Some minor code changes due to get rid of new gcc compiler
warnings.<br>
<br>
      - Moved some misc.h, string.h inline functions to misc.c, string.c
respectively to<br>
        get rid of compiler warnings<br>
<br>
      - added new flag SPLITHEURISTIC, enabling additional selection of any
ground input <br>
        conjecture clauses for splitting.<br>
<br>
      - added Signal support, with makefile optioon SPASSIGNALS, the standard
signals are catched<br>
<br>
      - fixed a bug in ana_CalculateFunctionPrecedence that could cause a
segmentation fault<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 2.1<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in the definition module. Formulae were not normalized
before<br>
        application of the procedure, leading to wrong matchings of
variables.<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in the flag module. The subproof flagstore settings were
not<br>
        complete: ordering flag and the weight flags were missing.<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in dfgparser.y, where a missing semicolon with<br>
        bison version 1.75 now caused an error.<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in cnf.c where the formula &quot;equiv(false,false)&quot;
was<br>
        not properly treated in function cnf_RemoveTrivialAtoms.<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in symbol_LowerSignature where capital 'A's and 'Z's were
not<br>
        prefixed by a lowercase 'ss' due to their exclusion in the condition.
This<br>
        caused problems in the result of dfg2tptp applied to dfg input files
with<br>
        uppercase symbols starting with an 'A' or 'Z'.<br>
<br>
      - Now dfg2otter negates conjecture formulae of the SPASS input file<br>
        before printing the Otter usable list.<br>
<br>
      - Added man pages for dfg2ascii, dfg2otter and dfg2tptp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 2.0.0<br>
<br>
      - Corrections to spellings, documentation.<br>
<br>
      - Added handbooks for SPASS and dfg2dfg.<br>
<br>
      - Added contextual rewriting.<br>
<br>
      - Added semantic tautology check.<br>
<br>
      - Fixed bugs in CNF translation: Renaming, Equation elimination
rules.<br>
<br>
      - Improved splitting clause selection on the basis of reduction
potential.<br>
<br>
      - Improved robustness of initial clause list ordering.<br>
<br>
      - Added the terminator module.<br>
<br>
      - Extended formula definition detection/expansion to so called guarded
definitions.<br>
<br>
      - Improved determination of initial precedence such that as many as
possible<br>
        equations in the input clause list can be oriented.<br>
<br>
      - Added mainloop without complete interreduction.<br>
<br>
      - Developed PROOFSEARCH data type enabling a modularization of the
SPASS<br>
        source code on search engine level, such that several proof attempts
can<br>
        now be run completely independantly at the same time within
SPASS.<br>
<br>
      - Moved GUI to Qt 3.0. The GUI now also includes dfg2dfg and new even
more<br>
        user friendly layout. The GUI runs on any platform where SPASS and Qt
are<br>
        available.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 1.0.5<br>
<br>
      - Improved SPASS man pages: In particular, we added further detailed
<br>
        explanations of inference rule flags and soft typing flags.<br>
<br>
      - Significantly improved modularity of the code by making the
flagstore<br>
        object part of the proof search object; so there is no global
flagstore<br>
        around anymore. These changes touched nearly all modules.<br>
<br>
      - Changed certain clause generation procedures such that now applying
SPASS<br>
        directly to a formula or subsequent application of FLOTTER and SPASS
produce<br>
        exactly the same ordering of a clause set (literlas). Since the
behaviour of<br>
        SPASS is not independant from initial clause/literal orderings the
changes<br>
        make SPASS results a little more robust/more predictable.<br>
        As all code was touched, we also included a code style review
(comments,<br>
        prototypes, ...).<br>
<br>
      - Flag values given to SPASS are now checked and rejected if out of
range.<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 1.0.4<br>
<br>
      - Changed some clause generation functions such that sequentially<br>
        applying FLOTTER, SPASS and just applying SPASS result in the<br>
        very same clause sets.<br>
<br>
      - Added the new tool dfg2dfg that supports transformations into<br>
        monadic clause classes and their further approximations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 1.0.3<br>
<br>
      - Sharpend renaming; it now potentially produces fewer clauses.<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 1.0.2<br>
<br>
      - Fixed inconsistencies between the DFG proof format description in
<br>
        dfgsyntax.ps and the actual implementation. Proof checking is more
<br>
        more liberal, because the empty clause needs not to have the
highest<br>
        clause number.<br>
<br>
<br>
Version: 1.0.1<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in the atom definition support where it could happen<br>
          that variable dependencies between the atom definition and
formulae<br>
          outside the definition are discarded.<br>
<br>
      - Fixed a bug in the renaming module, where in some cases a
renaming<br>
        with non-zero benefit was not performed.<br>
<br>
<br>
